## Wireframes

https://www.figma.com/file/W1HXtNdRRg2s1hMuPDYGxY/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1

The above wireframe depicts a single page website with a header, containing the text "Recipe Rolodex" and a circle shaped logo image underneath. Below the logo image will be a search bar and submit button where the user can enter whichever recipe they would like to explore. Beneath the search and submit button will be two containers side by side, one with an image of the searched recipe to the left and the ingredients/recipe to the right. The bottom of the page will feature a footer where my name and information will be posted, as well as attribution to the API I am using. 

### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP 
- Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the website
- Use AXIOS to retrieve and display data from the recipe puppy API on the DOM
- Display data on the webpage
- structure the page according to the linked wireframe above, utilizing CSS and Flex Box
- Create a search bar and submit button that display the recipes below
- When searched, display the image and recipe 
- when a new search is initiated, delete the existing recipe and image
- Implement responsive design using a media query
- Deploy the site

#### PostMVP  
- Add an animation during the loading period, which is after submit is pushed and before the content loads
- Create a second randomization button, which, when clicked, will generate a random recipe for the user instead of a specified recipe

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
